# Exercise 01: Set up and manage an SQL Managed Instance in Azure

## Scenario

Adatum Corporation is a national retail chain headquartered in Atlanta, GA, with 1,500 stores across the United States. The company is dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge technology and AI-driven tools to improve customer interactions and streamline operations. Adatum Corporation recently launched an eBook store, Adatum Books. They are currently using an on-premises SQL VM to store their data and application. Concerned about business continuity and potential disruptions to their eBook shopping services, they seek to implement a solution that ensures high availability and disaster recovery.

This exercise is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in setting up and managing an SQL Managed Instance in Azure. Throughout this exercise, you'll explore various aspects of SQL Managed Instance, including its configuration, network connectivity, and data replication.

You'll work with Azure SQL Managed Instance, a fully managed SQL Server database engine that provides built-in high availability, automated backups, and scaling capabilities; SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), which offers full control over the SQL Server environment and integration with other Azure services; and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), a powerful tool for managing SQL Server instances, databases, and their components.

By the end of this exercise, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to set up, configure, and manage an SQL Managed Instance in Azure. You'll also gain practical experience in ensuring network connectivity, replicating data, and performing failovers, which are essential skills for managing SQL databases in a cloud environment.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you'll be able to:

-   Set up, configure, and manage a SQL Managed Instance in Azure.
-   Replicate data between SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance.
-   Perform failovers, ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.

## Duration
