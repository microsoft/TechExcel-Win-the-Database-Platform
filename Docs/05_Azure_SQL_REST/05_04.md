# Task 04: Implement a filtered Semantic Search with SQL

## Introduction

Adatum Corporation wants to enhance their search capabilities by combining traditional SQL queries with vector-based search functionalities. The hybrid approach will allow Adatum to provide more accurate and relevant search results.

## Description

In this task, you’ll implement a filtered semantic search using SQL. Specifically, you’ll use vector embeddings to find the most relevant products based on a textual description and apply filters for availability and sale price. Then, you’ll perform a hybrid search in a SQL database, leveraging both traditional and vector-based search techniques to deliver more precise and meaningful search results.

## Success criteria

-   You successfully utilized vector embeddings to identify the most relevant products based on textual descriptions.
-   You applied filters for availability and sale price to refine the search results.
-   You combined traditional SQL queries with vector-based search capabilities to enhance the search results.

### 01: Use a SQL Query for a hybrid search

  <summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary> 

The following SQL script demonstrates how to perform a hybrid search in a SQL database. It uses vector embeddings to find the most relevant products based on a textual description and combines with 'Available=True' and 'Sale price of \<=50'.

1.  Enter the following in a new query:

    ```SQL-wrap
    /*-- Declare the search text*/
    declare @search_text nvarchar(max) = 'help me plan a high school graduation party'
    
    /*-- Declare a variable to hold the search vector*/
    declare @search_vector vector(1536)
    
    /*-- Generate the search vector using the 'create_embeddings' stored procedure*/
    exec dbo.create_embeddings @search_text, @search_vector output;
    SELECT TOP(10)
    id, product_name, description, sale_price,
    
    /*-- Calculate the cosine distance between the search vector and product description vectors*/
    vector_distance('cosine', @search_vector, product_description_vector) AS distance
    FROM [dbo].[walmart_product_details]
    WHERE sale_price <= 50 -- Filter by sale price
    AND available = 'TRUE' -- Filter by availability
    ORDER BY distance; -- Order by the closest distance
    ```
