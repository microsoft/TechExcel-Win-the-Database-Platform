## Task 02: Complete offline and online migration 

## Introduction 

Migrating databases to the cloud requires careful planning to balance downtime, data integrity, and service continuity. The City of Metropolis needs to migrate its PostgreSQL database from an on-premises server to Azure Database for PostgreSQL while minimizing disruption. To achieve this, you'll perform both offline and online migrations.

An offline migration transfers all data in a single operation, requiring downtime but offering a simpler process. In contrast, an online migration allows data replication while keeping the source database operational until the final cutover. By using both methods, the city can assess migration strategies that best meet its operational needs.

## Description 

In this task, you'll complete an offline and an online migration of the City of Metropolis's PostgreSQL database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL. You'll start by performing an offline migration, which involves stopping database activity, transferring all data at once, and validating the results. Next, you'll configure and execute an online migration, allowing data replication while keeping the database available.

These steps help ensure the city's critical services can transition to Azure Database for PostgreSQL efficiently, with minimal downtime and maximum data integrity.

## Success criteria 

- You successfully configured and executed an offline migration of the PostgreSQL database.
- You validated that all data was migrated correctly in offline mode.
- You successfully configured logical replication for an online migration.
- You executed an online migration, ensuring data synchronization between on-premises and Azure.
- You verified that all database records were successfully transferred and are accessible in Azure.

However, in a production environment, pay attention to this setting to determine when you're about to overwrite data. 

1. Select **Start Validation and Migration**. 

    {: .warning }
    > This process may take 3-4 minutes. 

    {: .important }
    > An online migration has more steps and takes a bit more time, but the source server applications aren't stopped in the process. Data is copied to the target server, then a cutover is performed to finalize the migration with no downtime in between. 

1. Select **Refresh** on the **azuredb@lab.LabInstance.Id - Migration** page periodically until the **onlinemigration** job status shows as **Waiting For Use**. 

1. From the Windows taskbar, select **Windows PowerShell**.

1. Run the following command to connect to the newly migrated **Adventureworks** database: 

    ```
    psql -h @lab.Variable(privateIP) -p 5432 -U postgres Adventureworks
    ``` 

1. Enter `@lab.VirtualMachine(Windows1124H2).Password` for the password.

    {: .warning }
    > The text cursor for password entry does not move. You may need to select **Enter** a couple times.

    {: .note }
    > The warning is safe to ignore.

1. Once connected to the **Adventureworks** database, run the following command: 

    ```
    SELECT name FROM humanresources.department;
    ``` 

    ![su5t1tdu.jpg](../../media/su5t1tdu.jpg)

    {: .important }
    > This command should return a list of 16 rows, showing the records in the **department** table. Since the online migration hasn't been completed yet, the data is being pulled from the offline migration performed earlier. With the online migration method, data can be added even after the migration has started, as long as the cutover hasn't been performed yet. Let's add a new row now to test this. 

1. Run the following command to add a new row to the **department** table. 

    ```
    INSERT INTO humanresources.department VALUES (17, 'Logistics', 'Inventory Management', DEFAULT);
    ``` 

1. Minimize the PowerShell connection, you'll return to it later. 

1. Return to the Azure portal and the **azuredb@lab.LabInstance.Id - Migration** page. 

1. Select **onlinemigration** from the list.

    ![on4t9ntj.jpg](../../media/on4t9ntj.jpg)
